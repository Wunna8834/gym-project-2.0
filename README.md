## What is Server Action

Asynchronous functions which are executed on servers and can be used in both "client" and "server" components for data fetching and mutation.

With server actions, there is no need to use `api routes` for http methods, "POST, GET, PATCH, PUT, DELETE". All of these can be performed by function execution.

In the previous version, api routes are used to hanlde http methods. In this version, server actions are used.
